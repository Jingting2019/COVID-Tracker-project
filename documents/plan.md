# The plan of developing COVID-19 Tracker site

### objectives
Knowing the data of one disease is a useful way to protect oneself and keep healthy. The COVID-19 Tracker website will be designed to visualize the total number of infected people by countries of public data from a third-party API. This project does not develop for once. We can reuse this framework to track any global disease especially for global infectious diseases such as flu.
